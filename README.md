# Neural Network Splice Algorithm for splice sites prediction

Gene prediction is the process of finding the location of genes and other meaningful subsequences in DNA sequences. This process is time consuming and expensive when done by  biochemical methods and genetics. There is existed another approach that makes genes to be predicted by analysing the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA using a statistical method. Then the process is carried out in a computer system, which is faster and less expensive. The DNA molecule contains subsequences that codes protein chains. The proteins form the functionality of the organism. The subsequences that code to these proteins are called genes. In eukaryotic cells, the gene sequences consist of exons and introns. The exon part is coding to proteins while the intron part is rejected in the splicing process. The transition between exon and intron, and the transitions between intron and exon are called donor splice site and acceptor splice site, respectively. The algorithm tries to predict the splice sites in the genes. As a function approximator artificial neural network is used. It is connected to a gene sequence and the system tries to predict the slice sites in the sequence.
